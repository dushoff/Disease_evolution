This is a talk that JD gave at the Santa Fe Institute.

In theory it should be possible to make the talk, and to trace where all of the resources (particularly pictures and diagrams) come from, by cloning the repo and typing `make`.

So far, this will definitely _not_ work on Windows (although I would like it to). There is also no real guarantee of backward compatibility from associated repos (although I will try to maintain that).

If you are desperate to make the talk (this seems unlikely), and things aren't working, you should try using "checkout" to reset linked repos to December 2016.

If the make rules can't find an image on the web at a place where it thinks they are, the image has moved, and there is nothing I can do about it (you can try to grab the image from an archived version of the talk).
